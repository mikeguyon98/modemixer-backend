Graphics and Logo Files:**\\n   - Provide detailed illustration files for:\\n     - Embossed logo design\\n     - Pattern and layout of stitching\\n     - Textural details on leather (creases, scars)\\n     - Metal elements (buckles, zippers, snap buttons) showcasing aged effects\\n\\nThese design specifications are aimed at ensuring the manufacturer fully captures the rugged, vintage aesthetic of the jacket, balancing functional elements of motorcycle apparel with a strong visual narrative of adventure and enduring use.', \"**Fabric Treatment Section for Techpack**\\n\\n**Material Specifications:**\\n- **Primary Material:** Genuine Cow Leather\\n- **Quality:** Premium, Aged and Weathered\\n- **Thickness:** 1.2-1.4mm for optimal durability and protection.\\n\\n**Color and Finish:**\\n- **Base Color:** Dark Brown\\n- **Finish:** Matte with a slightly oily touch for water resistance and ruggedness.\\n\\n**Leather Treatment Methods:**\\n1. **Distressing:** The leather should be mechanically distressed to replicate the wear and tear seen on the sample. Focus on areas such as the collar, pockets, waistband, and sleeves where movement creates natural creasing and fading.\\n2. **Creasing:** Artificial creases need to be applied to mimic years of usage. This effect is especially necessary around the bending areas such as armholes and elbows.\\n3. **Embossing:** The jacket features an ornate, rectangular logo embossed centrally above the chest zipper. The embossing process should use vintage-style dies to ensure that the logo appears authentically faded and worn.\\n4. **Weathering:** Apply a subtle, uneven application of a lighter shade of brown dye to promote an unevenly faded look which adds to the vintage aesthetic. Areas near seams and stitches should have slight discoloration to highlight usage.\\n\\n**Stitching and Detailing:**\\n- **Stitch Type:** Use heavy-duty polyester thread for all stitching, ensuring that it complements the rugged look while providing adequate seam strength.\\n- **Stitch Detailing:** Highlight stitching lines by using a slightly contrasting thread color to enhance the patchwork and segment detailing, particularly visible on the ridged panels of the sleeves.\\n\\n**Hardware Treatment:**\\n- **Zipper and Buckles:** All metal components, including zippers, pull-tabs, and buckles, should undergo an oxidation process to create an aged, corroded look consistent with extensive wear and exposure.\\n- **Placement of Zipper and Buckles:** Ensure all zippers are backed with a leather placket to conceal the hardware when closed, maintaining the jacket’s streamlined look.\\n\\n**Additional Features:**\\n- **Edge Finishing:** All edges, particularly around the cuffs, collar, and hem, should be finished with a binding or a turnover seam to prevent fraying and maintain the integrity of the distressed look.\\n- **Protective Coating:** A final application of a protective clear coat may be used sparingly to protect against additional wear while maintaining the leather's natural ability to age gracefully.\\n\\nThis comprehensive treatment plan will ensure that the jacket not only meets the aesthetic requirements as described but also upholds the quality and durability needed for motorcycle apparel. The detailed specifications are to be followed to replicate the exact vintage and rugged character as desired.\", '**Techpack - Measurements Section: Vintage Motorcycle Jacket**\\n\\n**1.
